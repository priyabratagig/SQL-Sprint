-- Challenge 4:
-- Use a SELECT DISTINCT statement to get the distinct (i.e.
-- unique) values that occur in the locality column from the
-- bird.antarctic_populations table.

SELECT DISTINCT locality
FROM bird.antarctic_populations;

-- Challenge 5:
-- Use a SELECT DISTINCT statement to get the distinct
-- combinations of values for both the locality and
-- species_id columns from the bird.antarctic_populations
-- table.

SELECT DISTINCT locality, species_id
FROM bird.antarctic_populations;
