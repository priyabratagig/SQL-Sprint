# DISTINCT

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in SQL to return only distinct (different) values or value pairs. The basic syntax is:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT [column1, column2, ...] FROM table_name;
```

It can be used with other clauses such as `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` to further filter the results.
